ID Card Detection System
Project Overview
The ID Card Detection System is an automated solution that utilizes a webcam to detect, decode barcodes on ID cards, and retrieve associated details from a database in real time. This project aims to streamline identity verification by eliminating manual checking processes, making it faster, more efficient, and less prone to errors.

Features
Real-time ID card barcode detection using a webcam.
Preprocessing techniques such as grayscale conversion and noise reduction to enhance image clarity.
Barcode decoding (supports Code 128) to extract and display ID card information.
Integration with an SQLite3 database to store and manage ID cardholder details.
User-friendly interface for easy interaction with the system.
Folder Structure
app.py: Main Python script to run the web application.
templates/: Contains HTML files, including index.html, for the user interface.
database/: Contains the SQLite3 database where ID details are stored.
Technologies Used
Python: Main programming language.
Flask: Web framework for the application.
OpenCV: Image processing for webcam integration.
Pyzbar: Barcode detection and decoding.
SQLite3: Database for managing ID cardholder data.
Setup and Installation
Prerequisites
Make sure you have the following installed:

Python 3.x
Flask
OpenCV
Pyzbar
SQLite3
Install Dependencies
To install the necessary dependencies, run the following command:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Running the Application
Clone the repository:

bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git
Navigate to the project folder:

bash
Copy code
cd your-project-folder
Start the application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the application: Open your web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000 to use the system.

System Workflow
Webcam Capture: The system captures real-time video from a connected webcam.
Image Preprocessing: It processes the captured image using grayscale conversion and noise reduction techniques to enhance barcode visibility.
Barcode Detection and Decoding: The barcode on the ID card is detected and decoded.
Database Query: The decoded information is used to query the SQLite3 database to retrieve the associated details of the cardholder.
User Display: The relevant ID card details (e.g., name, department, roll number) are displayed on the user interface.
Future Enhancements
Support for Additional Barcode Types: Extend support for QR codes and other formats.
Integration with Face Recognition: Add a layer of security by incorporating facial recognition.
Improved Security: Implement encryption and multi-factor authentication for enhanced data protection.
